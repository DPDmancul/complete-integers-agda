# Complete integers

See [interactive version](https://dpdmancul.gitlab.io/complete-integers-agda/).

---

<!--README-->
In this work we will define a superset of integers (the complete integers),
which contains the dual of integers along parity (e.g. the odd zero, the
even one, ...). Then we will see how they form a ring and can be used to define
an TODO (parlare di x^l = |x|)
<!--/README-->

## Build

1. Clone the repo <https://gitlab.com/DPDmancul/complete-integers-agda.git>
2. Optionally run `nix-shell` to get all the required dependencies into 
   the environment
3. Just run `make` to build all;
   `make html`, `make pdf` or `make epub` to build only one format.
